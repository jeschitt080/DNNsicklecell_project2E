# DNNsicklecell_project2E
Scientific Question: Can images of blood cells be classified as normal or sickle as a way to help diagnose sickle cell anemia?  
Scientific Hypothesis: If there are physiological differences that can be shown in images between normal and sickle red blood cells, then a model can be trained to categorize images of blood cells into each type.

In order to run the code you will need:
1) the jupyter notebook
2) the zipped dataset
